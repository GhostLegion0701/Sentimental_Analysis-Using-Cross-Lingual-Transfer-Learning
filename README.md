# Sentiment Analysis Using Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning
üìå Project Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a widely used Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that helps determine whether a given text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. However, most sentiment analysis models are trained on labeled data in a single language, making them ineffective for languages with limited annotated datasets.

This project explores Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning to improve sentiment analysis across multiple languages, leveraging pre-trained multilingual models to minimize the need for labeled data in low-resource languages.

By training a sentiment classifier in one language (such as English) and adapting it for other languages, we aim to build a scalable, efficient, and resource-friendly sentiment analysis model.

üéØ Objectives
Develop a multilingual sentiment analysis model capable of analyzing sentiments across different languages.
Utilize Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning to generalize sentiment classification from a high-resource language (e.g., English) to low-resource languages.
Fine-tune pre-trained multilingual transformers such as mBERT, XLM-R, or mT5 on a labeled sentiment dataset.
Evaluate the model‚Äôs effectiveness on different languages using various performance metrics.

üõ† Methodology
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Collect sentiment-labeled datasets from sources like:
IMDb (Movie Reviews)
Amazon Reviews (Customer Sentiment)
Twitter Sentiment Analysis Datasets
Preprocess the text by:
Removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuations.
Tokenizing and normalizing the text.
Encoding labels (positive, negative, neutral).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training
Choose pre-trained multilingual models, such as:
mBERT (Multilingual BERT)
XLM-R (Cross-lingual Language Model RoBERTa)
mT5 (Multilingual T5)
Fine-tune the model using sentiment-labeled data in one source language (e.g., English).
Use Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning to adapt the trained model for other languages without requiring large labeled datasets.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Performance Metrics
Test the model‚Äôs performance on multiple target languages.
Use standard evaluation metrics:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix for error analysis
Compare the performance of monolingual vs. cross-lingual models.
üìå Expected Outcomes
A robust, multilingual sentiment analysis model that works for low-resource languages.
Reduced dependency on large labeled datasets for every language.
Insights into the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning for sentiment classification.

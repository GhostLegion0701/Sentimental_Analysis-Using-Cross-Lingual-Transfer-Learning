# Sentiment Analysis Using Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a widely used Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that helps determine whether a given text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. However, most sentiment analysis models are trained on labeled data in a single language, making them ineffective for languages with limited annotated datasets.

This project explores Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning to improve sentiment analysis across multiple languages, leveraging pre-trained multilingual models to minimize the need for labeled data in low-resource languages.

By training a sentiment classifier in one language (such as English) and adapting it for other languages, we aim to build a scalable, efficient, and resource-friendly sentiment analysis model.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Develop a multilingual sentiment analysis model capable of analyzing sentiments across different languages.
Utilize Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning to generalize sentiment classification from a high-resource language (e.g., English) to low-resource languages.
Fine-tune pre-trained multilingual transformers such as mBERT, XLM-R, or mT5 on a labeled sentiment dataset.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness on different languages using various performance metrics.
